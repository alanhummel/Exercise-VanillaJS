**Currency Converter**
- Applicant name: Alan Hummel - ahummel@gmail.com

Currency Converter created for a job application.

It contains no external references as requested, outside the currency site "http://api.fixer.io/latest" which is accessed
by the application for verifying the current exchange rate.

**Installation instructions**

Download/Checkout the application into a folder.

**Usage**

The _currencyconverter.html_ uses a single component of the currency converter application.

The _container.html_ adds 3 components on the same page. (Working partially on Google Chrome)

**BUGs and TODO**
Currently the implementation does not fully comprise componentization. It is not working on Firefox, IE or Safari, and on Chrome it is not fully functional since the other instances are not creating dynamic IDs.
